# Next Steps

- Future enhancement one: I'm think of adding a new audio feature, when the game starts, the game will play a beautiful music, and when player flip a card, there will have click sound.
- Future enhancement two: More levels? For now there are only 16 cards which is level 1. I want to make a button that player can choose different level, like level 2---- 32 cards, and time limit?
